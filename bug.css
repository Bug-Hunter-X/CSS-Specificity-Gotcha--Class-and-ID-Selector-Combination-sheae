The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
}

#container {
  width: 200px;
}

.container #container {
  width: 150px;
}
```

The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when both a class selector (`.container`) and an ID selector (`#container`) are used within the same element.  While it might seem that the most specific selector (`.container #container`) would win, the CSS engine treats it as two separate selectors, and the order of declarations within the stylesheet plays a significant role.

In this case, the specificity of `.container` and `#container` are both equal. Thus,  the last declaration wins.  If the stylesheet is reversed or the last declaration is changed, the resulting width will also change.
